# Approach

1. As per the requirement, I have to create a python program which acts like a library for API's response comparison whicha are comes from two different text files.

2. I created a python class "APIComparator" which takes two arguments file1 and file2.

3. Then I have created a method which is take a url and returns the response of that url.

4. Then I have created another method which takes two url and uses the send_request method to hit those url and print the responses of different urls according to define format.

5. I make response1 and response2 variable as global variable, so that I can use those anywhere in this script.

6. Then I have created another method compare_response, which uses the class variable and access all the urls present in both files.

7. Then it uses the compare_and_print method to log the comparison between different API's.

8. are_responses_equal is kind of helper method which checks the response1 and response2 of API and return the boolean response.
